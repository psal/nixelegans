Keyboard controls
*******************

With a mouse you can rotate the scene (LeftMouseBtn+move), move it (RightMouseBtn+move) 
or change scale with a mouse wheel.

Pressing "F1" key in the program shows all available commands and their description
(readme_change_dir.png).

The Neural Network Editor currently allows only selection of pseudoneurons with a mouse and moving them in 3D
by keys described in "F1 help", as well as saving to file (overwrites existing one).

Build Instructions

prj\CyberElegans.sln is the VisualStudio2008 solution file

After opening it please set

-- it is being changed to "" each time when project is opened on another computer.

To run in "neural network editor" mode comment entire line 176
